## Overview
This project aims to analyze the phylogenetic relationships among several viruses, including Dengue (DENV-2, DENV-4), Chikungunya (CHIKV), Zika (ZIKV), and Yellow Fever (YFV). The analysis was conducted using the MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) software with the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method to construct a phylogenetic tree based on genetic sequence data.

## Methodology
- Data Collection: Genetic sequences of the viruses were collected in FASTA format from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.
- Phylogenetic Tree Construction: The data was imported into MEGA.; The Maximum Likelihood (ML) method was applied with bootstrap replication for statistical validation.
- Analysis and Interpretation: The generated phylogenetic tree illustrates the evolutionary relationships among the analyzed viruses.; Pairwise Distance Analysis was performed to measure the genetic similarity between viruses.

## Tools & Technologies
MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis)
Python / R (for additional data analysis, if needed)
NCBI Database for genetic sequence data

## Conclusion
This phylogenetic analysis provides valuable insights into the evolutionary relationships between these viruses, which can aid in epidemiological studies and disease control strategies. The pairwise distance analysis further supports the accuracy of the phylogenetic relationships identified.
